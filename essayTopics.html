					<li data-theme="b">What view does the novel take on romanticism?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The novel seems to depict romanticism and love as something more of an obstacle rather than a worthy life goal.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Santiago's Personal Legend requires him to go on a quest that will take him across North Africa, and in doing so he must put any desires of love either behind or on hold.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Santiago admits to desiring the Merchant's daughter, and even states that he would be willing to give up his Personal Legend for her.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This view goes to show that the novel reflects that love should come second to Personal Legends and goals. Santiago comes to realize this when he sets out for the pyramids.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Once he decides to take the journey and give up his chances with the Merchant's Daughter, he surprisingly meets another woman, Fatima, who he views as the one.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However, again he must put her aside to reach his goal and risk losing her forever.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though this is extremely difficult, again he choses the quest over romance.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the end Santiago ends up with his love, Fatima, however it wasn't without risk.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">These examples go on to show, that contradictory to popular literature, the novel takes on a belief that personal achievement ranks higher than romantic achievement.</li>
				</ul>

					<li data-theme="b">What is the novel's view on the tale of Narcissus, and how does it relate to the novel as a whole?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Before the novel begins, the reader is told of the story of Narcissus, a classic Greek tale, however in the prologue, a twist is added.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the story of Narcissus, the character Narcissus is so enthralled with his reflection in a lake that he falls in and drowns.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However, in the novel, it is added that the lake is also enthralled with its own reflection in Narcissus' eyes that it becomes very depressed when Narcissus drowns.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The novel seems to suggest that perhaps narcissism is not as terrible of a trait as we have come to believe, and that instead it is a natural trait embodied by everyone.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The rest of the novel seems to stick to this belief that focussing on one's self is an important trait.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Santiago must put himself first in many instances throughout the novel in order to reach his own Personal Legend.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In doing so, though it may appear as if Santiago is vane, in reality his Personal Legend is very important in him reaching his potential as a human, as well as a better understanding of the world as a whole.</li>
