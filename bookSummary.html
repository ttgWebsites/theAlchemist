					<li data-theme="d">The Alchemist is a fictional novel that was written in the late 1980's and has developed into an extremely famous
					and thought provoking piece of literature. The novel follows a character, Santiago, as he grows from a young adult who 
					works as a shepherd into a man worthy of great respect. In his growth and development as a young adult, Santiago learns 
					of something known as his Personal Legend after he speaks with a gypsy who interprets an odd dream. A Personal Legend is
					a person's ultimate life goal that trumps anything else that they could accomplish. Santiago's legend is to travel to the
					pyramids in Egypt where he is supposed to discover a vast treasure. His journey, though daunting, appeals to Santiago, however he must be 
					willing to fight off many of his greatest fears in order to succeed. The journey for Santiago's Personal Legend takes him across his homeland 
					of Spain to Northern Africa and the Sahara Desert. His adventure introduces him to a wide variety of influential and interesting people who
					provide layers to the novel. The most significant of all the characters Santiago meets is a man known as The Alchemist, thus prompting the 
					title of the novel. The Alchemist lives in the Al-Fayoum Oasis in the Sahara Desert and practices his trade. When Santiago meets the Alchemist 
					he comes to discover that he was destined to be the Alchemist's apprentice. Through their encounters and working together both men are able to 
					complete their Personal Legends as Santiago discovers the treasure he was searching for, and the Alchemist is able to turn precious metals into gold.
					The novel is a fascinating work of fiction, and though the story is not true, the life lessons the novel teaches about reaching ones potential 
					are very important. The Alchemist has become a best selling book over the last two decades, and rightfully so, as everyone can take from
					Santiago's sacrifices and journey and incorporate what they learned into bettering themselves.</li>
