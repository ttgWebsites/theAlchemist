					<li data-theme="b">Fear</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the novel Santiago must fight through various personal fears in order to reach his Personal Legend.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Santiago is filled with many fears and doubts, and each of them presents a major obstacle that he must overcome in order to be successful in his journey.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Santiago grew up with a great fear of having a gypsy interpreting his dream, however without doing so he would never have found the path he must take for his journey.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He also encounters many other fears on the way, he fears what will become of his life if he gives up his material wealth for the journey, he also has to overcome the fear of dying when he faces the dangers of the great battle in Al-Fayoum.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Santiago learns from many of his mentors that fear in general cannot be tolerated or else one will fail in all of their goals.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He manages to put aside his fears to complete his journey.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Other characters are also plagued by fear such as the Crystal Merchant.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Crystal Merchant is a devout Muslim, and every Muslim is supposed to make the pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lifetime.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Merchant desires to do so, however he fears that by doing so he will have nothing else to live for.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He therefore puts it off, and in doing so leads a very sad and unhappy life, yet if he put his fear aside, he could be a much happier man.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Personal Legends and How They Fit in One's Life</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The novel depicts something known as a Personal Legend, which is essentially a quest that one must undertake to achieve the most out of their life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The novel goes on to suggest that without achieving one's Personal Legend, one cannot lead a successful and satisfying existence.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">There are several examples of the importance of a Personal Legend in the novel, particularly Santiago, The Alchemist, and the Crystal Merchant.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Santiago and The Alchemist both set out to complete their Personal Legends.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In doing so they sacrifice much, however they receive much more in return for success.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Meanwhile the Crystal Merchant is not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to complete his Personal Legend, and in doing so he sacrifices his chances at being successful and leading a worthwhile life.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The novel makes a great argument through the idea of Personal Legends that if one does not pursue their dreams than one leads a pointless existence.</li>
